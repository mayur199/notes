Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the HTTP status codes categorized by their series:

### 1.  **200 Series (Successful Responses)** :

These codes indicate that the request has been successfully processed.

* **200 OK** : The request has been successfully processed, and the server has returned the requested resource.
* **201 Created** : The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
* **202 Accepted** : The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.
* **204 No Content** : The request has been successfully processed, but there is no content to return.
* **206 Partial Content** : The server is delivering only a portion of the resource (used in range requests).

### 2.  **300 Series (Redirection)** :

These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, usually a redirection.

* **301 Moved Permanently** : The resource has been permanently moved to a new URL, and future requests should use this new URL.
* **302 Found** : The resource has been temporarily moved to a new URL. The client should continue to use the original URL for future requests.
* **303 See Other** : The client should access the resource at another URL using the GET method.
* **304 Not Modified** : The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the client can use its cached version.
* **307 Temporary Redirect** : The request should be repeated to a different URL, but the original URL should be used for future requests.
* **308 Permanent Redirect** : Similar to 301, but the method used for the request (like POST or GET) should remain the same when redirected.

### 3.  **400 Series (Client Errors)** :

These codes indicate that the client has made an error in the request.

* **400 Bad Request** : The server could not understand the request due to malformed syntax.
* **401 Unauthorized** : The request lacks proper authentication or is unauthorized.
* **403 Forbidden** : The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
* **404 Not Found** : The requested resource could not be found on the server.
* **405 Method Not Allowed** : The method used in the request (e.g., GET, POST) is not allowed for the resource.
* **408 Request Timeout** : The server timed out waiting for the request.
* **409 Conflict** : The request could not be processed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
* **413 Payload Too Large** : The request is too large for the server to process.
* **415 Unsupported Media Type** : The server cannot process the request due to unsupported media type.
* **429 Too Many Requests** : The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.

### 4.  **500 Series (Server Errors)** :

These codes indicate that the server has encountered an error or is otherwise incapable of performing the request.

* **500 Internal Server Error** : A generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the server.
* **501 Not Implemented** : The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
* **502 Bad Gateway** : The server, while acting as a gateway, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
* **503 Service Unavailable** : The server is currently unavailable (e.g., due to overload or maintenance).
* **504 Gateway Timeout** : The server, while acting as a gateway, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.
* **505 HTTP Version Not Supported** : The server does not support the HTTP version used in the request.

These categories help indicate the nature of the response and what action (if any) is needed to resolve issues.
