HTTP methods define the actions that can be performed on resources in a web application. They specify how the client and server interact to process requests and return responses. Below are the most commonly used HTTP methods:

### 1.  **GET** :

* **Purpose** : Retrieves data from the server (e.g., a webpage or resource).
* **Characteristics** :
* Should not modify the server's data.
* Can be cached.
* Parameters can be passed in the URL (query string).
* **Example** :

```http
  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
```

### 2.  **POST** :

* **Purpose** : Sends data to the server to create a new resource or submit a form.
* **Characteristics** :
* Can modify the server's data (e.g., create a new record in a database).
* Data is sent in the request body (not visible in the URL).
* Not idempotent (sending the same request multiple times may have different effects).
* **Example** :

```http
  POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Content-Length: 27

  name=John&age=30
```

### 3.  **PUT** :

* **Purpose** : Replaces an existing resource or creates a new resource at the specified URL.
* **Characteristics** :
* If the resource exists, it is replaced with the new data provided in the request body.
* If the resource does not exist, it can be created.
* Idempotent (multiple identical requests will have the same effect).
* **Example** :

```http
  PUT /users/123 HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 32

  {"name":"John", "age":30}
```

### 4.  **DELETE** :

* **Purpose** : Deletes a resource identified by the URL.
* **Characteristics** :
* Removes the resource from the server.
* Idempotent (multiple identical requests will have the same effect, i.e., the resource remains deleted).
* **Example** :

```http
  DELETE /users/123 HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
```

### 5.  **PATCH** :

* **Purpose** : Applies partial modifications to a resource.
* **Characteristics** :
* Unlike PUT, which replaces the entire resource, PATCH updates only the specified fields.
* Used for partial updates to a resource.
* Idempotent (if the same PATCH request is made multiple times, it has the same effect).
* **Example** :

```http
  PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 18

  {"age":31}
```

### 6.  **OPTIONS** :

* **Purpose** : Describes the communication options for the target resource.
* **Characteristics** :
* Used to request information about what methods are allowed on a resource.
* Often used for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
* Typically used to check the server's capabilities or permissions.
* **Example** :

```http
  OPTIONS /users/123 HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
```

### 7.  **HEAD** :

* **Purpose** : Retrieves only the headers of a resource, not the actual content.
* **Characteristics** :
* Similar to GET, but it does not return a body, only headers (used for testing or retrieving metadata).
* Can be used to check if a resource exists or to retrieve information like content type, length, etc., without downloading the entire content.
* **Example** :

```http
  HEAD /index.html HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
```

### 8.  **TRACE** :

* **Purpose** : Echoes back the received request, used for diagnostic purposes.
* **Characteristics** :
* The server responds with the exact request it received.
* Mostly used for debugging and tracing.
* **Example** :

```http
  TRACE /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
```

### 9.  **CONNECT** :

* **Purpose** : Establishes a tunnel to the server, often used for SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connections.
* **Characteristics** :
* Primarily used by HTTP proxies to connect to a remote server.
* Typically used in the context of HTTPS connections.
* **Example** :

```http
  CONNECT www.example.com:443 HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
```

### Summary Table of HTTP Methods:

| **Method**  | **Purpose**                             | **Characteristics**                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **GET**     | Retrieve data from the server                 | Safe, cacheable, does not modify server data           |
| **POST**    | Submit data to create a new resource          | Can modify server data, not idempotent                 |
| **PUT**     | Replace or create a resource                  | Idempotent, replaces the entire resource               |
| **DELETE**  | Remove a resource                             | Idempotent, deletes the resource                       |
| **PATCH**   | Partially update a resource                   | Idempotent, modifies specific parts of the resource    |
| **OPTIONS** | Describe communication options for a resource | Used to inquire about allowed methods and CORS support |
| **HEAD**    | Retrieve headers of a resource                | Similar to GET, but without the body                   |
| **TRACE**   | Echo back the received request                | Used for diagnostics and tracing                       |
| **CONNECT** | Establish a tunnel to the server              | Often used for SSL connections                         |

These methods define how clients interact with resources on the web, with each method serving a specific purpose for different use cases.
